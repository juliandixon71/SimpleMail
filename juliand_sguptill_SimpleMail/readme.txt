--- Completed Features ---
	* Allows user to configure data for their system and network
	* Contact database with add, edit, and delete functionality
	  Also saves contacts when closing
	* Allows user to send emails

--- Extra Credit Features ---
	* Allows user to attach files to an e-mail
	* Added an Inbox which allows user to view emails on double click 
	  This feature is incomplete, I had a lot of trouble parsing the 
	  content of multipart messages. But the table does correctly show
	  who the email is from, the subject, and the date sent.

Would have liked to construct a better inbox. I wanted to have a JTabbedPane with
tabs for unread, sent mail, trash, drafts, etc.
